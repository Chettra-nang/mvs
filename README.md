# CLIP-RLDrive: Vision-Language Reward Shaping for Autonomous Driving

A complete implementation of CLIP-based reward shaping for reinforcement learning in autonomous driving scenarios, based on the paper methodology from [CLIP-RLDrive](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.16201v1).

## 🚀 Features

- **Complete Training Pipeline**: Data collection → CLIP fine-tuning → RL training → Evaluation
- **Multi-Algorithm Support**: DQN and PPO with CLIP reward shaping
- **Production Ready**: Optimized for high-end GPUs (RTX 5090 configs included)
- **Paper Aligned**: Faithful implementation of the research methodology
- **Gated Reward System**: CLIP rewards only applied when confidence threshold is met

```

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd test2
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv clip_rl_env
source clip_rl_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
clip_rl_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Training (RTX 3080/4090)
```bash
python clip-rl.py
```

### High-Performance Training (RTX 5090)
```bash
# Modify clip-rl.py to use RTX 5090 config
python clip-rl.py
```

## 📊 Training Pipeline

### 1. Data Collection
- Collects intersection driving scenarios
- Generates (image, text) pairs using heuristics
- Default: 100 episodes → ~400 samples
- RTX 5090: 5000 episodes → ~50K samples

### 2. CLIP Fine-tuning
- Fine-tunes last layers of CLIP ViT-B/32
- Contrastive learning on driving scenarios
- Default: 15 epochs, batch_size=32
- RTX 5090: 50 epochs, batch_size=256

### 3. RL Training
- Trains DQN and PPO agents
- CLIP rewards gated by confidence threshold
- Default: 8K timesteps
- RTX 5090: 1M timesteps, 16 parallel envs

### 4. Evaluation
- Compares CLIP vs vanilla agents
- Metrics: Success rate, collision rate, rewards
- 50 episodes per evaluation

## ⚙️ Configuration

### RTX 5090 Optimization
```python
# In rtx5090_config.py
COLLECT_DATA_EPISODES = 5000    # 10x more data
CLIP_BATCH_SIZE = 256          # 8x larger batches  
RL_TIMESTEPS = 1_000_000       # 125x more training
PARALLEL_ENVS = 16             # Multi-environment
```

### Key Parameters
```python
# CLIP Fine-tuning
CLIP_LR = 1e-5                 # Learning rate
CLIP_EPOCHS = 15               # Training epochs
FREEZE_BOTTOM_LAYERS = True    # Only train last layers

# RL Training  
WEIGHT_CLIP = 1.2              # CLIP reward weight
PROB_THRESHOLD = 0.6           # Confidence threshold
GAMMA = 0.95                   # Discount factor

# Environment
OBSERVATION_SHAPE = (128, 64)  # Grayscale resolution
STACK_SIZE = 4                 # Frame stacking
DURATION = 30                  # Episode length (seconds)
```

## 📈 Expected Results

### Performance Metrics
- **Success Rate**: 0-20% (intersection is challenging)
- **Collision Rate**: 30-50% 
- **Training Time**: 30min (basic) → 4-6hrs (RTX 5090)
- **CLIP Reward**: Typically 0.3-0.8 cosine similarity

### Memory Usage
- **RTX 3080**: ~8GB VRAM, 16GB RAM
- **RTX 4090**: ~12GB VRAM, 32GB RAM  
- **RTX 5090**: ~16GB VRAM, 64GB RAM (scaled config)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. CUDA Out of Memory**
```bash
# Reduce batch size
CLIP_BATCH_SIZE = 16  # instead of 32
```

**2. FP16 Gradient Scaling Error**
```bash
# Already fixed in current version
# Uses FP32 training to avoid gradient issues
```

**3. CLIP Rewards showing 0.0000 or NaN**
```bash
# FIXED in v1.5!
# - Lowered threshold from 0.6 to 0.3
# - Added debugging output
# - Should now see: "CLIP Stats: X/Y (30-50% apply rate)"
```

**4. Low Success Rates**
```bash
# FIXED in v1.5!
# - Increased from 8K to 50K timesteps
# - Should now see 5-15% success (vs 0%)
# - For production: use RTX 5090 version with 1M timesteps
```

**5. How to verify CLIP is working**
```bash
# Look for these messages during training:
✓ CLIP reward applied: r_clip=0.523, prob=0.412
CLIP Stats: 342/1000 (34.2% apply rate)

# If you see 0% apply rate, threshold may need adjustment
```
